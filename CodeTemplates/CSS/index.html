            This is a story about proving, with data, that <i>No Diggity</i> by Blackstreet is timeless.
        </h3>

        <p>
            Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music.
            Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of release.
        </p>

        <p>
            But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all of music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are fading into obscurity.
            And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.
        </p>

        <p>
            20 years have passed since <i>No Diggity's</i> release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from the 90's,
            is a strong signal for whether it will be remembered by our childrens's children. So let's examine every song that ever charted,
            1990-1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.
