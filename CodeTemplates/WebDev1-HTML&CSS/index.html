        In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lil' Wayne's ascent is the story of <b>Cash Money</b>. The Dirty South starts with <b>LaFace Records</b>. The east-coast/west-coast fued is <b> Bad Boy vs, Death Row</b>. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.

        we wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard(collaborating with 
        <a href="twitter.com/kevinbeacham">Kevin Beacham</a> of 
        <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). 
        By highlighting the labels that produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was weilding enormous influence on sound, distribution, and direction.
