        Theres this thing called the Bechdel Test. It measures just how male-dominated our beloved Netflix nights really are. To pass, films need to satisfy three requirements:

                    1. It has at least two women in it

                    2. Who talk to each other, about

        Its a low bar, but many good movies dont pass. <i>Birdman</i> fails. <i>Avitar</i> fails. Fucking <i>Toy Story</i> fails. 
        On <a href="bechdeltest.com">bechdeltest.com</a>, a site for croudsourcing Bechdel Test results, about

        Why? Rather than generalize a sexist system, one theory is simple: filmmakers, unintentionally, make movies about themselves (i.e., write what you know). 
        Since most powerful producers, writers, and directors are men, male-themes permeate into Hollywood's output.
        To see if women (i.e, pass the Bechdel test), we compiled the genders of the producers, writers, and directors on thousands of films.
