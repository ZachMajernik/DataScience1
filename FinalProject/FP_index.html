            <h1>Which Fast Food Place is Best for Your Diet Type?</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Have you ever found yourself paralyzed by the simple question “Where do you want to eat?” If you’re like many people these days,
                The very thought of deciding where to eat can send a shiver down your spine. In your defense, how are you supposed to chose?
                This one, seemingly easy question opens up a barrage of many others: Do I want sitdown or fast food? Chinese or Mexican? Will their food fit with my diet?!
                With about 50,000 different fast food chains and over 200,000 locations spread out across the US, It can feel impossible to choose.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are seemingly infinite options, and that’s not even to mention whether or not the food is even good for you!
                The food we put into our bodies have drastic effects on our physical health. If we aren’t meeting our bodies dietary needs,
                we can be putting our bodies at some serious risk, especially those who have serious medical conditions. Not eating right now can endanger our bodies in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, however, I aim to alleviate some of that worry.
                I am going to compare eight of the most popular fast food chains and tell you how they stack up against each other and which ones fit best for your specific dietary needs.
                You got low blood sugar? High colesteral? Are you just starting in the gym and want to find out which fast food place will give you the biggest muscles? No problem!
                These restaurants have just what you need, all we need to do is a little digging to figure out which one is right for you!

                    There are Thousands upon thousands of fast food restaurants in just the U.S. alone!
                    With all these choices it can be very hard to figure out where to eat and even harder which ones have the best options for you.
                    The graph below shows how many there are (in the U.S.) of each restaurant we will be looking at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used a dataset made by <a href="https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=fastfood" target="_blank">openintro.org</a> that contains almost the entire menue
                    (not including some sides like fries) from eight different fast food chains:<br />
                    Taco Bell, Subway, Burger King, Mcdonalds, Arby's, Sonic, Dairy Queen, Chick Fil-A.<br />
                    I also cross-referenced some of the items from the dataset with the nutrition facts from that restaurant's official website to confirm legitamacy.

        <div>
            <p>
                For all the diets covered, Chick-Fil-A and Dairy Queen are the best restaurants to eat at for low sodium, low carb, low calorie and low fat diets 
                with their wide range of different options with the exception of McDonalds being the best option for a high protein diet. 
                Just these two or three restaurants alone can support most any dietary needs you have.
